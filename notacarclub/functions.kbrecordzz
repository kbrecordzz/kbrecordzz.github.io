sprite_talk_27: Hello, animals in cars. We are the saviors of everything.
sprite_talk_27: We have sensed energy from another dimension.
sprite_talk_28: Yeah, they¿re partying like crazy donkeys over there.
sprite_talk_27: I'm not talking about the Pitbull dimension. I¿m talking about¿ The Beginning And End Of All¿ Dimension.
d: That sound spooky!
sprite_talk_28: 
//dorime dorime, bävern stiger upp lite mot himlen igen.
sprite_talk_27: The Beginning And End Of All Dimension is the origin of our universe. Of you, and me, and of all that have existed.
sprite_talk_28: Beavers were invented there, for example.
sprite_talk_27: Let me tell you about how all of this started. I mean, how this world started. How we all got here.
a: Yes, story time!!
sprite_talk_27:  I¿ll take you back to a time before time, in a space before space.
a: HOW is that possible?
d: Ssh! Maybe he¿ll explain if you¿re quiet!
sprite_talk_27:  Nah, I don¿t really know how it¿s possible. It sounds pretty impossible. But that¿s how my script starts, so¿
sprite_talk_27:  At first, everything was black. And empty. Then came something, even if things didn¿t exist yet. It was¿ the Universe constant.
dg: *GASP*
sprite_talk_27: Ljudet dånade. Färger som aldrig funnits förut uppenbarade sig.
sprite_tak_27: Men det totala kaoset skänkte en onekbar känsla av lugn och tillfredsställelse, och till slut lade sig också allt skakande, dånande och flimrande.
sprite_talk_27: Enter The Universe constant. It's just a number, but it¿s also so much more than a number.
sprite_talk_27: It's the number that all terrain shapes, all personalities and all societal systems originate from.
sprite_talk_27: Some people claim that some kind of \"grelf curve\" has affected the world in a similar way as well.
dg: Life isn't a number's game, you capitalist.
sprite_talk_27: From the Universe constant, a bunch of other numbers were calculated.
sprite_talk_27: All the numbers got intertwined with each other to make a good mix for the world, and here¿s where the good part starts -
sprite_talk_27: A council of 36 specimen decided how to twist the numbers further, to create a more interesting and curated shape of the world.
sprite_talk_27: Yes, I¿m talking about The Council of Beavers.
d: *spills his popcorn* Wait, that¿s you! Wow! I didn¿t see that coming!
sprite_talk_27:  You¿re not that much of a story guy, right? This is like formula 1A when it comes to story twists. The big reveal, you know?
d: Not a story guy? Do you know who you¿re talking to?
sprite_talk_27:  Honestly, no. I don¿t know who you are.
d: *large gasp* What¿s even the point of me hiding under this large fedora?!
A: Hey, beavers, it's cool that you're here, and I think beavers are cool.
a: But I don¿t understand anything of your babbling. THIS is how the world was created.

a: How could the Big Bang happen if there was no universe yet?
dg: Hmm, you got me there. That's a good point.
a: So, while I was doing 3x70 death-push ups with triple-combined bended knee-lifts to impress a lady elk,
a: I created the universe with my brain power. And with my leg power of course. And, with my arm power!
a: And my hand power, and my back power, and... my hair power and my...

dg: Can someone stop him before he gets to that body part?

dg: Regardless, the world was obviously created imperfect. And science doesn't have all the answers.
dg: Of course, we need to find the truth of what has been. But we also have to look into the future!
dg: What ideas should influence our world? How should we shape the world to fit us the best?
dg: When will the utopia that Marx described come to reality?

sprite_talk_zanzibae: That's why I get to talk in this epilogue. The beavers ain't shit to me!
sprite_talk_zanzibae: So, what happened to our friends when the adventures ceased?
d: Daddy got stuck in a anxiety loop of complicated thoughts, which stopped him from getting a job or even maintaining his hobbies.
d: He never spoke to anyone in the car club again, despite riding the same maglev train as them every day.
dg: Dark Gandalf did a philosophy course at the university and started to see communism's flaws.
dg: Unfortunately, his cognitive dissonance made him unable to admit it to himself, so he continued beying a cynical opinion warrior on the internet and never became truly happy.
a: Adele continued to constantly work out, but he finally got caught red-handed by the police after years of using, producing, selling and spreading propaganda about steroids.
a: In prison he made a name for himself by becoming a personal trainer for the inmates, and by using, producing, selling and propagating about steroids.
o: O'Malley got a bipolar disorder and stress-induced cancer in four different bodyparts at four different moments.
o: All of this made him incredibly stressed, which turned into a dark pattern of stress leading to cancer leading to stress, and so on. He also got a hot girlfriend.

sprite_talk_zanzibae: I guess Mrs Superconductor wasn't joking with all those legal threats?
d: Daddy became a \"bitch\" to a tiny but aggressive inmate, which meant he had to read bedtime stories for him and wash him long and carefully.
d: The bedtime stories became his creative outlet, and he soon released his first book from inside prison: \"Life according to a fucking MANIAC\", after being positively encouraged by O'Malley.
dg: Dark Gandalf started The Leninistic And Stalinistic Society inside prison and also got Adele to understand his ideas.
dg: He also started eating copious amounts of schnitzel.
a: Adele realized how important long-term health was, and started developing a new healthy version of steroids made out of prison floor, prison wall and prison guard hat.
a: He became very popular among the inmates, probably because they were scared of him.
o: O'Malley grew a beard and got a rumour of being \"tiny but aggressive\" after punching Daddy in the balls during their first day.
o: Yes, O'Malley was the inmate having Daddy as his \"bitch\". O'Malley really let his evil sides flourish. Sad, because didn't we all root for him earlier?

o: or maybe they will get BOTH a well-cooked inside and outside by the long cooking time! not too bad, huh?
o: but, too bad you can't see the degrees on this oven... i guess i'll have to put in my hand and feel how warm it is that way.
o: so... what now? god, i hate the minutes between putting the fries into the oven and taking them out...
o: it just feels so... empty. it's so depressing to wait for things...
o: and you kind of can't start thinking of anything else, because your mind is way too stuck on fries.
o: i guess i could call someone... but i would probably only be talking about fries, and people have told me they're tired of that.
o: they say it's the only thing they even slightly dislike about me, but it's still annoying enough to almost break up with me.
o: oh god, now they're getting burnt! time flies when i'm philosophizing by myself!!
o: gladly, the dull 20 minutes went by quickly this time.
o: but now i have a new problem: are the fries too burnt?
o: maybe. maybe not. it's kind of hard to decide.
o: i guess i'll have to eat them to see.
o: *eats one fries*
o: *smiles widely*
o: they're perfect.
o: oh, someone called? did i accidentally answer the phone while putting the fries into the oven?
o: yeah it seems like that. *hangs up*
