p: Well come on then, Shelf! Follow me!
p: I have a farm over at the Valley of Sacred Mystery. I've had it since 1943.
p: I inherited it from my father, Andrzej Lewandowski, after he passed away.
p: He was a humble man. For example, he didn't tell me about his billions of dollars until after he died.
p: Yeah, I'm a billionaire. Don't tell anyone.
p: So... The car club isn't going very well, right?
p: Too bad. Illegal underground clubs have a tendency to not last very long.

p: Here it is! My farm! So, why not get started? Hay needs to be cut!
p: So, what are you waiting for, Shelf? All yellow grass needs to be cut, and it needs to be done now!
p: Haha, I'm just messing with you. You can cut it in any pace you want.
p: So, where was I? Oh right, my dad. When he was born, everyone got confused.
p: He doesn't look Polish at all, said Papa Gramps.
p: But that was just because Papa Gramps forgot his glasses that day!
p: Hahaha! Yeah, I have a pretty crazy family.
p: When dad got in his teenage, he started to get into agriculture.
p: Mostly because he was forced to, because of the extreme poverty.
p: My dad learned how to use the tractor at a young age, and also how to break it.
p: Haha, one time he tried to start the tractor but he hadn't even put in the key.
p: So of course, it didn't start. Haha!
p: Then he ran back into the house, and asked his mom for the key.
p: Then, when he put the key into the tractor, it started as usual.
p: Phew! A sigh of relief, haha.
p: He actually had to run the farm until he was 18. By then, he was allowed to move out and pursue his own dreams.
p: To become a normal cow.
p: You know, not the kind of cow that runs the farm, but the kind of cow that lives at the farm.
p: That kind of life is much easier.
p: He traded the freedom for the comfort. That's my pops!
p: So he moved to another farm, and that's actually where he met his wife: Polish Wife.
p: They... did the thing... I think... and then I was born.
p: But now I'm getting ahead of myself. There are a couple of happenings before that that I need to cover too.

//sprite_talk_28: Yeah, they're partying like crazy donkeys over there.

o: Yes, Mrs Superconductor sent us to some dimension, I think!
sprite_talk_27: That's not a surprise. Mrs Superconductor has been breaking the laws of physics since the dawn of time...
p: A bit of an exaggeration though, ey?
sprite_talk_27: Silence, cow!
sprite_talk_27: Let me tell you about how it all began.
a: Yes, story time!!
//sprite_talk_27: The Beginning And End Of All Dimension is the origin of our universe. Of you, and me, and of all that have existed.
//sprite_talk_28: Beavers were invented there, for example.
//sprite_talk_27: Let me tell you about how all of this started. I mean, how this world started. How we all got here.
//sprite_talk_27:  I'll take you back to a time before time, in a space before space.
//a: HOW is that possible?
//d: Ssh! Maybe he'll explain if you're quiet!
//sprite_talk_27:  Nah, I don¿t really know how it¿s possible. It sounds pretty impossible. But that¿s how my script starts, so¿
//sprite_talk_27:  At first, everything was black. And empty. Then came something, even if things didn¿t exist yet. It was¿ the Universe constant.
//dg: *GASP*
//sprite_talk_27: In the beginning, there was nothing.
//sprite_talk_28: Except for some wood.
//sprite_talk_27: And one single number. The Universe constant...
//sprite_talk_27: From the Universe constant, a bunch of other numbers were calculated.
//sprite_talk_27: All the numbers intertwined with each other to create good physical laws, and - here's where the good part starts -
sprite_talk_27: At the dawn of time, a council of 36 specimen was created to help with creating the universe.
sprite_talk_27: Yes, I'm talking about The Council of Beavers. That's us.
sprite_talk_27: We designed new physical laws and constants, to make sure the universe was beautiful, functional and entertaining.
sprite_talk_27: We were all beavers, except for one... One cat.
sprite_talk_27: A cat called \"Mrs Superconductor\".
m: We needed another animal to balance out the vast overflow of beavers in the Council, but it didn't turn out as we hoped for.
m: Mrs Superconductor always had her own ideas. Whenever we were seconds to finish a new physical constant, she always interrupted with a long rant about magnets.
m: Magnet atoms. Magnet molecules. Magnet planets. Magnet cars.
m: And when she came up with the idea for a magnet train... She kind of lost her mind.
m: She wouldn't stop talking about it, and we grew more and more tired of her hour-long rants.
m: We were right in the middle of designing the solar systems, and we always got interrupted by her rants.
sprite_talk_27: So we slowly decided to set her free from the Council, to restore its peace, and hopefully to make her feel better too.
sprite_talk_27: I guess it can't be easy being a lone cat around 36 beavers?
sprite_talk_27: But... It didn't go as we hoped for. She never stopped with her magnet train thing.
sprite_talk_27: And now, she seems to have sworn to destroy everything in the world, to make place for more maglev trains.
sprite_talk_27: Less animals, less nature, less happiness, less love... means more free space for maglev trains.
sprite_talk_27: At least in Mrs Superconductor's disturbed mind.
sprite_talk_27: We had a plan for a good world...
sprite_talk_27: But someone else had other plans.

dg: Dark Gandalf did a philosophy course at the university and started to see communism's flaws.

a: Adele continued to constantly work out, but he finally got caught red-handed by the police after years of using, producing, selling and spreading propaganda about steroids.

o: O'Malley got a bipolar disorder and stress-induced cancer in four different bodyparts at four different moments.
o: All of this made him incredibly stressed, which turned into a dark pattern of stress leading to cancer leading to stress, and so on. He also got a hot girlfriend.
